# Lesson 1 — Getting Set Up

**Goal:** make sure Git + editor are installed, Git is configured, and you can talk to GitHub (SSH).  
If you already have everything, blitz through the checks and flex.

---

## 0) Install the tools (if missing)

- **Git:** https://git-scm.com/downloads  
- **VS Code (recommended):** https://code.visualstudio.com/

> Windows tip: accept “Git Credential Manager” during install.  
> macOS tip: on first `git` use, macOS may prompt to install developer tools—allow it.

## 1) Verify your versions

```bash
git --version
code --version   # VS Code; on macOS you may need to enable 'code' from PATH via VS Code Command Palette
